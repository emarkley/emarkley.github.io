Hello!  Thanks for visiting my website.  I am a PhD student in the Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering at [UC Berkeley/UCSF](https://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/).  I am a member of the Dr. Laura Waller's [Computational Imaging Lab](laurawaller.com) located on Berkeley's campus.  My research is primarily on data-driven end-to-end system design.  Prior to coming to the Bay Area, I earned a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the joint program involving the [University of North Carolina -- Chapel Hill](unc.edu) and [North Carolina State University](ncsu.edu).  I also earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from UNC--Chapel Hill.  While in Chapel Hill, I worked in Dr. Paul Dayton's [group](https://daytonlab.sites.unc.edu/).  Here I worked on problems in super-resolution ultrasound as well as echocardiography for diving safety.  Outside of lab I enjoy spending my time getting outside whether that be through climbing, biking, or skiing.
